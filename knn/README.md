# K-Nearest Neighbours Package

This module contains various implementations of KNN. These are listed down as follows:

- sequential
    - two-loop KNN
    - Vector KNN
    - KD Tree KNN
- parallel
    - Parallel Vector KNN
    - Parallel KD Tree KNN


### Directory Structure

- `utils.py`: Several utilites like Data Generator, Data Streamer, etc.
- `core.py`: Implemplentation of KNN algorithm
- `driver.py` : Runner file to debug the core implmentations.
- `experiments.py`: Utilities to run experiments for benchmarking algorithms.
